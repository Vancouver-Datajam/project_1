# Zaid's Team Project: Earth Challenge Integrated Data: Plastic Pollution

## Team members' names: <>

## Project Description: 

Plastic pollution is one of the most pressing threats to our global oceans. From providing us with half of the oxygen we breathe and stabilizing our climate, to feeding over one billion people worldwide, the oceans are vital to our everyday wellbeing.  However, each year an unprecedented amount of plastic litter- an average of 8 mln tonnes - make their way to the marine realm, having devastating consequences for wildlife and compromising our ecosystem's health. Because 80% of plastic litter is estimated to originate from land, we can all take action towards a healthier future for our environment and ourselves by tackling our individual plastic footprint. A 2018 study found that 1.1 billion of single-use items including bags and cups filled Metro Vancouver landfills - equivalent of 400 items per resident (source: TRI Environmental Consulting)

1- Problem    
Plastic pollution is one of the most pressing threats to our global oceans. Our shorelines have many plastics that may end up in oceans and other water bodies. 
Identify and forecast plastic accumulatoin and help plan for volunteers and events for shoreline cleanups.     
      
2- Dataset     
Canadian Shoreline clean up    
    
3- Why interesting     
Apply predicitve modelling to platic pollution data set.
